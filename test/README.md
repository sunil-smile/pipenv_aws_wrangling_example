# Testing

For Pyspark testing we can use the library **chispa** , which provides lot of helper functions

```bash
├── __init__.py                 # package file is must         
├── conftest.py                 # to setup the variables which can be used across the test methods   
└── test_utilfunctions.py       # declaring all the test case methods   
```
